Cooking Recipe

![Chocolate Puddle Cake](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/chocolate-puddle-cakes.jpg?w=750)

Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, plus more for dishes
* 2 teaspoons cocoa powder, plus more for dusting
* 3 ounces (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
* 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt or a couple pinches of flaky salt
* 1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 25 grams) granulated sugar (see Note)
* 1 large egg
* 1 egg yolk

Directions:

Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Butter two 6-ounce ramekins or baking cups, making sure not to miss any spots. Spoon a little cocoa powder in each and pat it around so it coats the bottom and sides, then knock the excess out.
Place 4 tablespoons butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and — either in the microwave or set over a pot of gently simmering water — melt the butter and chocolate about two-thirds of the way, then whisk until it finishes melting. (This ensures it’s not too hot to add other ingredients.) Whisk in sugar and salt. Whisk in egg and yolk and beat a good 20 to 30 extra times, to ensure mixture is smooth, glossy, and a bit lightened.* Add 2 teaspoons cocoa powder and whisk until combined.

Divide between two baking dishes. Bake 7 to 9 minutes (7 will be the most molten in the center, 9 the least but still gooey) and transfer to a cooling rack for 1 minute. Wearing pot holders, place a small dessert plate over your first ramekin. Flip it onto the plate, count to ten, then lift the cup off. Repeat with second cake. Dust with cocoa powder or powdered sugar. Serve with barely sweetened whipped cream, a little ice cream, berries, or absolutely nothing at all. Eat immediately.

*Updated to note: This is really important! Don’t skip the extra 20 to 30 whisks around the bowl. For reference, this is how it looks when it’s not whisked enough (yes, been there, done that) and this (glossy and smooth) is how it looks when it is.

Do ahead: You can make the batter and fill the prepared cups, then refrigerate until you want to bake them. They can go into the oven directly from the fridge, but will need to bake 1 to 2 minutes longer.

No special season for meal and no variations of recipe.


Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ( ${\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbf {p} \mathbf {q} }}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d(\mathbf {p} ,\mathbf {q} )=d(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} )&={\sqrt {(q_{1}-p_{1})^{2}+(q_{2}-p_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(q_{n}-p_{n})^{2}}}\\[8pt]&={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^{2}}}.\end{aligned}}} {\displaystyle}
$$
 

 

 



The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
{\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }},} 
$$
where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points p and q may involve a direction (for example, from p to q), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by
$$
{\displaystyle \mathbf {q} -\mathbf {p} =(q_{1}-p_{1},q_{2}-p_{2},\cdots ,q_{n}-p_{n}).}
$$

In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from p to q. In any space it can be regarded as the position of q relative to p. It may also be called a displacement vector if p and q represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between p and q is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:
$$
{\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {q} -\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {(\mathbf {q} -\mathbf {p} )\cdot (\mathbf {q} -\mathbf {p} )}}.}
$$

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:
$$
{\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {q} -\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {\left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|^{2}+\left\|\mathbf {q} \right\|^{2}-2\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {q} }}.} 
$$

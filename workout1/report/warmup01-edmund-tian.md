**Introduction**

This current Golden State Warriors team is arguably one of the greatest teams in NBA history. At the same time, the argument could be made that they are breaking the game. A once beautiful game that involved intricate plays now consists of players dribbling up to the three point line and jacking up shots. GSW is the most successful shooting team in NBA history and the results have shown. Teams all over the league and around world emulate their strategy of jacking up shots in an attempt to achieve the same success that GSW has. Unfortunately, many of these teams simply don't have good enough shooters to make that work.
